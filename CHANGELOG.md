# Changelog

All notable changes to DisplayDeck are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org).

## [2.8.12] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed

- **Sharpen's shader mode was softer than off at fractional scales** - Force HiDPI sizes and scaled modes such as 1710 × 1112. It resampled the picture twice. It now sharpens at the screen's own resolution there and stays pixel-exact where the scale is a whole number.
- **Shader mode squeezed wide-gamut colours into sRGB.** It now captures and presents in Display P3.
- **Sharpen, Warmth, Contrast and the brightness boost now follow the real panel while HiDPI is forced.** Auto-sharpen used the virtual display's size and came out at 0%, the Sharpen slider saved its value where nothing read it, and Warmth and Contrast were ignored.
- **Contrast on its own added a slight warm tint** (about 2% less blue). No warmth now means no tint.
- **Brightness boost held about 500 MB of graphics memory** for a single flat colour. It now uses a tiny surface.
- **A failed Force HiDPI attempt could leave an invisible extra display behind** until the app quit.
- **Remote Access: SSH and Files to a peer ignored the relay key and port**, so they only worked with a relay on port 22 that also accepted your personal key.
- **Shader Mode switched on from Settings stayed off** if it had failed earlier in the session.
- **Changing Warmth or Contrast no longer flashes** the screen back to its profile between steps.

### Changed

- **Displays are listed by their real names** ("Built-in Retina Display", the monitor's model name) instead of "Built-in Display" and "External Display".
- **The Brightness slider remembers the last value sent to an external monitor** instead of always showing 100%.
- **Text Smoothing levels are hidden on macOS 27**, where Light, Medium and Strong draw text identically; the on/off switch remains.
- **Brightness can no longer be dragged above 100% while HiDPI is forced**, since the virtual display has no headroom to boost into.
- **Panel dithering stays off after a resolution change** when Disable Panel Dithering is set.
- Notifications name resolutions by their "looks like" size.

## [2.8.11] - 2026-10-10

### Changed

- **Brightness boost now sits above Sharpen**, so the screen is sharpened first and then boosted, instead of the boost being flattened by the sharpening overlay. The Sharpen shader leaves every DisplayDeck overlay out of its capture and restarts when one appears.
- **The Sharpen shader draws only the newest captured frame**, which steadies its lag at roughly 2-5 frames.

## [2.8.10] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- **Contrast - a per-display slider.** Bends tones into an S-curve in the display's gamma table, so text and edges stand out more. No capture and no lag; it combines with Warmth.
- **Disable Panel Dithering** in Settings → Display. Apple Silicon panels flicker pixels between neighbouring colours to fake extra depth; this keeps every pixel still, at the cost of slightly coarser gradients. It is re-applied after wake and restored when DisplayDeck quits.
- **Text Smoothing levels** in Settings: Light, Medium or Strong for the main Text Smoothing switch.

### Changed

- **Lower-latency presentation for the Sharpen shader**, though it still runs a few frames behind; the default Sharpen path has no lag.

## [2.8.9] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- **Sharpen radius.** Settings → Sharpen now offers Fine, Medium and Wide. Wider gives a bolder edge; it applies to both the default and shader modes.
- **Transparency Enabled** in Settings - a master switch that shows every window at 100% while keeping each app's stored value. Moving any transparency slider turns it back on.

### Fixed

- **The screenshot tool no longer sends an Escape key.** `tools/ddshot` closed the menu with a synthetic Escape, which went to whichever app had focus and could cancel a terminal session. It now closes the menu through Accessibility.

## [2.8.8] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- **A Sharpen section in Settings** with plain on/off items for everything the Sharpen row's icons do: Sharpen Enabled (a master switch that keeps your strength), Auto Strength for the Resolution, Shader Mode, and Keep Shader Mode on Battery.

## [2.8.7] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed

- **Sharpen shader no longer makes text look harsh or broken.** The shader could push pixels past their neighbours, which turned grey text black, stripped the anti-aliasing from letters and left halos. Each pixel is now limited to the range of its neighbours, so edges tighten while tone and smoothing are kept, even at 100%.

## [2.8.6] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- **Auto-sharpen.** The Ⓐ toggle on the Sharpen row picks the strength from the current resolution: off at the pixel-exact Retina size, rising to 50% at one pixel per point ("More Space"), and it follows resolution changes. Moving the slider turns it off.
- **Sharpen shader pauses on battery.** On battery the shader mode steps down to the no-capture path and comes back on the power adapter. "Use Sharpen Shader on Battery" in Settings keeps it on.

## [2.8.5] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- **Sharpen - a per-display slider under Warmth.** Applies an unsharp mask to the whole screen so small text reads crisper, which helps most at "More Space" sizes such as 2560 × 1664 on a 13" Air. It is composed in the window server from backdrop layers, so it needs no Screen Recording permission and adds no capture lag. The setting is remembered per display.
- **Sharpen shader mode** - the toggle beside the Sharpen slider. Captures the display at the panel's native pixel size and redraws it through a sharpening shader, with an exact (unfiltered) downscale to panel pixels and a stronger maximum than the default path. Needs Screen Recording permission; without it, or if capture stops, Sharpen falls back to the no-capture path.

## [2.8.4] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- **Transparency is now live and remembered per app.** A slider value is stored for the app and re-applied to new windows, windows on other Spaces, and the app after a relaunch. The list shows every regular app with windows, not just the ones visible on the current desktop, and "All Apps" also covers apps opened later. Windows return to 100% while DisplayDeck is not running and pick their values up again at launch.
- **A "Changes aren't applying" row** appears in the Transparency section when the helper in Dock is not actually changing windows.

### Fixed

- **The ★ in the Resolution menu now marks the mode that really is panel-native.** It was following macOS's "default" flag, which on notched MacBooks points at a scaled mode (1470 × 956 on a 13" Air). It now marks the one mode whose backing matches the panel's pixels exactly (1280 × 832 HiDPI there).

### Changed

- **Clearer menu wording.** "Install / Remove Crisp HiDPI…" is now "Install / Remove Extra HiDPI Resolutions…" (the added sizes above the ★ are softer, not crisper), "Disable" is "Disable Display", and menu items use Title Case throughout.
- **The Resolution and Force HiDPI menus now say that larger sizes trade sharpness for space.**

## [2.8.3] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed

- **Menu icons are back on macOS 27.** macOS 27 hides menu item images unless each item opts in, so the Snap, Arrange, Resolution, Settings and Quit rows lost their icons. Every menu item with an image now sets `preferredImageVisibility`.
- **The "Takes effect after you log back in" hint lines up under Text smoothing again** instead of sitting at the menu's left edge on macOS 27.

### Changed

- **Arrange Windows rows now use layout glyphs, matching Snap Window.** Four tiles for Grid 2×2, a window floating over the tiles for Centered over Grid, and the same glyph with an arrow for Promote to Main and Center Next / Previous.

## [2.8.2] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **One-click recovery for a disabled built-in.** Re-enabling the built-in after it was turned off with an external connected is impossible through macOS's display APIs - only restarting the login session brings it back. (Confirmed by exhaustive testing: every CoreGraphics/SkyLight re-enable path returns `kCGErrorIllegalArgument` for the built-in, even forcing a re-detect or supplying a full mode+origin, while external displays re-enable normally - the built-in is evicted from the window server's configurable set on disable.) The "couldn't re-enable" dialog now offers a **Log Out…** button that restarts the session for you, instead of only telling you to do it by hand.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Re-enabling the built-in no longer fails silently.** Disabling the built-in while an external display is connected leaves macOS unable to re-enable it from the app - the panel drops off the configurable display list, so the re-enable call comes back `kCGErrorIllegalArgument` and nothing happened. "Enable" now explains this with a dialog (log out and back in to restore the built-in) instead of doing nothing.
- **Disabling the built-in now warns first.** When an external is attached, disabling the built-in pops a warning that re-enabling it will require logging out, so you are not caught off guard.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Arrange every window on a screen at once - a new "Arrange Windows" section in the Window menu.** Window snapping has always moved the _focused_ window; this tiles _all_ of them and flips between layouts with a keystroke:
  - **Grid 2×2** (`⌃⌥⇧G`) fills the four quadrants (graceful fallback with 2-3 windows).
  - **Centered over Grid** (`⌃⌥⇧C`) floats one window centered and larger _over_ the 2×2, so the others stay visible around its edges.
  - **Cycle Layout** (`⌃⌥⇧Space`) toggles Grid ↔ Centered. **Promote to Main** (`⌃⌥⇧↩`) centers the focused window; **Center Next / Previous** (`⌃⌥⇧→` / `⌃⌥⇧←`) rotate which window is centered, bringing each fully to the front; **Restore** (`⌃⌥⇧Z`) puts everything back.
  - Uses the same Accessibility permission as window snapping - no SIP changes, works on a stock machine.

### Changed

- **Internal cleanup (no behaviour change).** Consolidated duplicated window/display helpers into shared units (Accessibility frame access, HiDPI size tables, the active-display query), trimming ~220 lines.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- **The Text smoothing toggle now tells you it needs a re-login.** macOS only reads the font-smoothing setting when an app _launches_, so flipping the toggle did nothing visible in already-open windows - it read as a dead switch. Added a caption under it: "Takes effect after you log back in." (What the toggle does is unchanged; on a Retina display the effect is subtle regardless.)

## [2.7.1] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- **Internal cleanup only - no user-facing change.** Removed dead code carried since earlier releases: an unused virtual-display termination handler (and its deferred-teardown bookkeeping) and three unused single-field relay setters. Behaviour is identical to 2.7.0.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Force HiDPI offers higher "looks like" resolutions.** It previously stopped at **3200×2000**; on 8 GB+ GPUs it now goes up to **3840×2400**, with **3360×2100** and **3456×2160** added in between. Force HiDPI renders to a virtual display at **2× the chosen size**, and the per-GPU framebuffer ceiling that gates this was conservative - a 3840×2400 target is a ~150 MB buffer, far under budget - so the ceiling was raised and finer scale steps added. (The window server redraws everything at that 2× size each frame, so the largest options ask more of the GPU.)

## [2.6.2] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **The Warmth slider is live across its whole range again.** The 2.6.1 auto-night change clamped warmth to a floor when auto was on, so dragging the lower part of the slider did nothing at night. Auto-night now treats the slider as the night **peak** and scales it by the schedule, so the slider always changes the warmth; with auto off it stays a direct, constant warmth.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Warmth now sticks across display changes.** macOS wipes the gamma table on resolution/HiDPI changes and sleep-wake, which silently dropped warmth until the night schedule next moved - the "sometimes warm, sometimes not". DisplayDeck now re-applies warmth right after a display reconfiguration and re-asserts it every minute, so it stays put.
- **Auto-night no longer cancels your manual warmth during the day.** Turning on the moon (auto) used to set the screen neutral until evening; now auto only ever _adds_ night warmth on top of whatever you've set, so your manual warmth always holds. (The moon lights only the **auto-night schedule** - your warmth can be on from the slider with the moon off.)

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Help & support in Settings** - quick links to **support the app**, **report a bug**, and **request a feature** (opens a pre-labeled GitHub issue).

### Fixed

- **Brightness and Warmth no longer disappear when a display's HiDPI is forced.** Forcing a resolution collapsed that display's section to just "Stop Forced HiDPI" - the brightness and warmth sliders were dropped, even though both still drive the real panel while it's mirrored. They're back. (Resolution, Force HiDPI, Crisp HiDPI and Disable stay hidden during a force on purpose - changing the physical mode would fight the active mirror, so stop the force first.)

## [2.5.3] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Row alignment made consistent across the rest of the menu.** The remaining icon-less informational rows now carry icons too, so none read as indented: the **inactive-display info line** (resolution/HiDPI/Hz) and the Transparency **"Backend not loaded"** / **"No windows"** states. The other submenus - Resolution, Force HiDPI, Snap Window, Settings, Keep-Awake durations - already used consistent column/checkmark layouts and were left as-is.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Remote Access menu rows line up consistently now.** The status, "This Mac", and per-Mac rows were plain text with an empty icon gutter, so they read as oddly indented next to the rows that had icons. Every row now carries an icon - a status dot, a desktop glyph for this Mac, and a **filled circle (online) / hollow circle (offline)** per Mac - so it reads as one uniform list instead of mixed indentation.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Remote Access now lists this Mac too**, marked **(this Mac)** with its live ● online / ○ offline status, so the device list is a complete view of every Mac on the relay - not just the others. (Shown for status; there's nothing to connect to on yourself, so it has no actions.)

## [2.5.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Remote Access - file transfer (SFTP).** Each discovered Mac now has a **Files** action that opens an SFTP session over the same relay tunnel, so you can move files to/from it alongside Screen Share and SSH.
- **Live peer online status.** Discovered Macs show **● online / ○ offline** - the relay now reports whether each Mac's tunnel is actually up, instead of just listing every authorized Mac, so you don't click into a peer that isn't there.
- **Keep awake while on.** An optional (default on) toggle holds an idle-sleep assertion while Remote Access is enabled, so the Mac stays reachable instead of dozing off and dropping the tunnel. (Idle sleep only - a closed laptop lid still sleeps.)
- **Connection error reasons.** When the tunnel can't connect, the status line now says _why_ - "Relay unreachable", "Relay rejected the key", "Relay port already in use", "Relay host not found", etc. - instead of an endless "Connecting…".

## [2.4.4] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Quitting now tears down Remote Access cleanly.** The reverse-SSH tunnel (and any Screen-Sharing forwards) were left running orphaned after the app quit, holding the relay's ports - so the next launch couldn't rebind them and the tunnel was stuck reconnecting. They're now stopped on quit, while the on/off setting is preserved so it still auto-restores next launch.
- **Quitting now restores windows you'd made transparent**, matching the documented behaviour. Previously they stayed transparent (the Dock-side overlay outlives the app) until the affected apps were relaunched.

### Changed

- Internal cleanup: removed dead code (an unused connect-command builder and a redundant font-smoothing branch). No behaviour change.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Text smoothing is now a simple On/Off toggle** instead of a multi-level control. Pixel-diffing rendered text confirmed that modern macOS treats `AppleFontSmoothing` as binary: levels Light/Medium/Strong come out **byte-identical** - only **Off vs On** actually changes how glyphs are drawn (off = thinner/lighter, on = dilated). The old strength gradient was removed by macOS years ago, so a slider implied distinctions that don't exist. On writes the standard level; Off disables smoothing. (Still applies after a re-login, since apps read it at launch.)

## [2.4.2] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Text smoothing is now a slider, not four spelled-out buttons.** It's a single discrete control - the same icon + slider + value layout as the Brightness and Warmth rows - that snaps **Off, Light, Medium, Strong** with the level name as its live label. Takes far less width and reads as one interactive control. It also **always shows your current level**: previously, when the system key was unset (the default state) nothing was highlighted, so you couldn't tell where you were; it now reflects the macOS default (Medium). Strong is the real ceiling - macOS's `AppleFontSmoothing` tops out at that level.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Stopping Force HiDPI no longer leaves a phantom display that can freeze the pointer.** Turning off a forced HiDPI resolution un-mirrored your panel but left the backing **virtual display** (a 2×-resolution framebuffer, e.g. 6400×4000) alive and parked in the display arrangement. That orphaned screen kept loading the WindowServer and could strand the mouse/trackpad off-screen - recoverable only by quitting the app. Stop now **destroys** the virtual display and flushes the removal with a display-reconfiguration pass (the same teardown the disconnect path uses), so the arrangement returns to just your real screen(s). Verified with an integration test across repeated force/stop cycles.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Remote Access - reach your Mac (and your other Macs) from anywhere, nothing to install.** DisplayDeck holds an auto-reconnecting reverse-SSH tunnel through a relay host you control (e.g. your own server), forwarding this Mac's **SSH** and **Screen Sharing** - no Tailscale, Headscale, or third-party agent. It's also a **client**: your other Macs on the same relay are **auto-discovered**, so you can **Screen Share** or **SSH** into them straight from the menu. The relay is set inline as a single `user@host:port` field; the on/off switch lives on the menu's Remote Access row.
- **Automatic night warmth.** Warmth now eases on in the evening and back off by morning on a schedule (dusk/dawn ramps), so the screen warms automatically without touching the slider. Toggle it with the **moon** button on the Warmth row - on by default.

### Changed

- **Menu sweep for consistency.** **Keep Awake** and **Remote Access** are each a single row with an inline on/off **toggle** plus a **›** chevron that opens its options (Keep Awake's timed durations; Remote's relay + connect list). Submenus size to their content instead of a fixed wide frame, the **Snap by dragging** / **Keyboard shortcuts** toggles moved into the **Window** submenu, and the **Text smoothing** control got a proper section header.

## [2.3.5] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Menu-bar mug icon no longer looks oversized or clipped on some Macs.** It now scales to the actual menu-bar height (clamped to the standard 15-18pt glyph range) instead of a fixed point size, so it fits correctly on standard (non-notched) menu bars and external displays, not just notched MacBooks.

## [2.3.4] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Homebrew install now works on macOS 14 and later.** The cask was mistakenly pinned to _exactly_ Sonoma (`depends_on macos: :sonoma`), so installs on Sequoia / macOS 26 were rejected with "does not run on macOS versions other than Sonoma." It now allows `>= :sonoma`.

### Changed

- Clarified that the app is **self-signed** (not ad-hoc), and documented the macOS 15+ Gatekeeper path (**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**, since right-click → Open was removed). The Homebrew cask still strips the quarantine flag automatically.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- Window snap-menu glyphs now use a **16:10 screen aspect** instead of the previous too-wide (~16:9) shape, so they read as a real Mac display.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- The **Window** snap menu now shows a **layout glyph** next to each item - a shaded region on a screen outline (Rectangle/Magnet style) - so each snap target is identifiable at a glance. Adapts to light/dark.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Accessibility no longer re-prompts after every update.** The app now signs with a stable code-signing identity instead of ad-hoc. An ad-hoc signature changes identity (cdhash) on every build, which silently invalidated the Accessibility grant that window snapping and Picture-in-Picture rely on - even though System Settings still showed it enabled. With a stable identity the grant persists across updates.
- **The "Window" menu no longer widens the menu** - its labels are now compact ("Snap Window", "Enable Snapping…") so the section fits the standard menu width.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Window management (tiling / snapping).** Snap the focused window to **halves, quarters, thirds & two-thirds, maximize, center, or restore** - three ways:
  - **Global keyboard shortcuts** - `⌃⌥` + arrows (halves), `⌃⌥` + U/I/J/K (quarters), `⌃⌥` + D/F/G (thirds), `⌃⌥` + E/T (two-thirds), `⌃⌥` + Return (maximize), `⌃⌥` + C (center), `⌃⌥` + Z (restore).
  - **Drag to snap** - drag a window to a screen edge or corner and it tiles, with a live preview (Magnet-style).
  - **Menu** - a "Window" section listing every layout.

  Uses the Accessibility API (the same permission as Picture-in-Picture) - works on a stock machine, no SIP changes. Keyboard shortcuts and drag-to-snap can each be toggled under **Settings → Window**.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Brightness boost above 100% works again.** A prior "no-washout" change clamped the EDR overlay to the display's live headroom, which silently turned the boost into a no-op on panels that report no grantable headroom (e.g. the built-in MacBook Air display). The overlay now presents the full requested boost again - genuinely brightening the screen - while still auto-suspending during Mission Control. On XDR/HDR panels it rides real headroom with detail intact; on standard panels it lifts overall luminance (with some highlight washout toward the top of the slider).

## [2.2.1] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **Text smoothing** is now an inline segmented control (Off, Light, Medium, Strong) in the main menu, instead of a submenu - one click, with the active level always visible.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Text smoothing** control (Off → Strong) - adjusts macOS's grayscale antialiasing so text isn't thin or fuzzy on external, non-Retina, or scaled monitors. Top-level in the menu; applies after a re-login.

### Changed

- **Force HiDPI** offers more "looks-like" resolutions, now gated by a **GPU-tuned rendered-framebuffer ceiling** (auto-scaled from the Metal memory budget - 5K/6K/8K/10K tiers) instead of a flat 1.5× cap. Small / 2K panels get more options; large panels stay protected from oversized buffers.

### Fixed

- The **pin**, **picture-in-picture**, and **auto-brightness** row toggles now show an active state (accent-tinted icon) instead of looking unchanged after a click.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **Renamed from DisplayDisabler to DisplayDeck** - the app does far more than disable displays (resolutions, brightness, warmth, window control, keep-awake), so the name now reflects the scope. Bundle id, paths, Homebrew cask (`pyxis3-ai/tap/displaydeck`), and website all moved accordingly. The old repo URL redirects.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Warmth** - per-display color-temperature slider (6500 K → ~3400 K) via gamma ramps, persisted, restores native ColorSync at 0%.
- **EDR brightness boost above 100%**, clamped to the display's real, learned headroom; auto-suspends during Mission Control.
- **Inline auto-brightness** toggle on the brightness row.
- **Window transparency** for any app via a self-contained scripting addition injected into Dock, plus **frosted-glass blur**, per-app **keep-on-top**, and **picture-in-picture**.
- **Force HiDPI** "More Space" supersampling tier and persistent crisp-HiDPI override plists.
- **Disable failsafe** - re-enables the built-in display if a disconnect (or a stale/phantom external) would otherwise leave no usable screen.
- Launch-at-login on by default.

### Changed

- Curated, correctly ordered resolution picker (★ = panel-native); removed duplicate/sub-60 Hz/absurd entries.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- Initial release: disable/enable any display, Force HiDPI via a mirrored virtual display, brightness control, and keep-awake.
